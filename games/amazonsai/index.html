  <p>
    An abstract strategy game with two teams taking turns back and forth. The last team to
    make a move wins.
  </p>
  <p>
    On a turn a player clicks
    one of their pieces to select it, then clicks a location to move it,
    then clicks a location to
    place a 'stone' blocker pieces. Pieces and stones move like queens,
    and cannot move through other pieces/stones.
  </p>

  <p>
    The entire website
    will freeze up while the AI is computing.
    Be careful to click "Make AI Move" just once because
    otherwise it will make multiple moves one-after-another.
    I can't run this webassembly in the background thread easily until

    are merged.
